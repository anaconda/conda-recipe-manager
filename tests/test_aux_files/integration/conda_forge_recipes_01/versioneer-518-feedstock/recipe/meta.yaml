  description: >
    This is a tool for managing a recorded version number in setuptools-based python projects. The goal is to remove the tedious and error-prone "update the embedded version string" step from your release process. Making a new release should be as easy as recording a new tag in your version-control system, and maybe making
    new tarballs.
